For this I created my own API endpoint: https://obaapi.gijsbertcharles.com/member/15
_(With a MongoDB database behind it, currently consists of ~20k users.)
Did I need to do this? No. Did I want to? Yes._

<a id="why"></a>
## ‚ùìWhy I created this 
It's kind of scary how easily you can make assumptions based of someone's loan History for books. The example I am using in my project, well very sensitive data. She has a child & either she's addicted to sex or her relationship isn't going too well. _(These are assumptions)._

<a id="how"></a>
#### How does it work
The OBA saved a lot of loan history data for every loan. I grouped all the loan data for each person to show you that you can make a lot of assumptions based on the books/dvd's.

## Installation
**Clone/Fork this repo & you're good to go. No NPM packages used.** Only HTML/CSS & vanilla javascript used.
